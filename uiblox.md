# the ultimate guide to UIBlox

UIBlox is Roblox's system for managing & creating UI's (basically). It's been used for a while, and all of their core scripts are gradually being switched to it. So naturally, the first question the pops into your head would be: "how the ### do I use this?!"

And the answer will most likely be "I don't know, who do you think I am?". But not today. Because believe it or not, the minds here at taintedtimthisisnotarealcompanytm have figured it out. Okay anyways here's how to do it.

# importing CorePackages

Firstly, you want to import the core packages. Now, you may be asking, how do I do that? Well, my lucky friend, here's how.

Luckily, rojo makes this easy for us. Since Roblox's CorePackages were actually *made* in Visual Studio Code & imported with rojo - it's incredibly easy. First, install the VS Code extension for rojo.

Once you've installed that visual studio code plugin (and I hope visual studio code), we can go on to the next step.
